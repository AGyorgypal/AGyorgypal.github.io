I am a T32 Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School and Massachussets General Hospital in the [Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/ciid). Working with [Robert M Anthony](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3xN1qSIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Michelle E. Conroy, my research explores the role and regulation of IgG and IgE glycosylation in health and disease. 

Antibodies are complex: IgG is highly effective at triggering inflammation and is essential for defense from infections and cancer. Allergen-specific IgE is absolutely required for allergic symptoms and disease, yet not all individuals with allergen-specific IgE suffer from allergies. My work in the [Anthony lab ](https://rmanthonylab.mgh.harvard.edu/) looks at unveiling the interplay between IgG and IgE antibdoies in health and disease with the overarching goal to development strategies that target and modulate glycans on antibodies to enabling antibody engineering in-vivo and ex-vivo to treat immunological disease such as cancer.

I reciveved my PhD in Biochemical Engineering from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://cbe.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University. My doctoral research focused on engineering a system to [study and control N-linked glycosylation](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/70295/) of monoclonal antibodies for the biomanufacture of immunotherapies. This innovative system, which I developed, was subsequently patented under the name “N-Glycanyzer.” I served as an [ORISE Fellow](https://orise.orau.gov/FDA/index.html) at the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (FDA-CDER) where I had validating the N-Glycanyzer system, demonstrating its practical applications in a regulatory environment.

I serve as a [Scientific Advisor](https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/scientific-advisory-board) and [Contibutor](https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/editor/aron-gyorgypal-phd) for [Technology Networks](https://www.technologynetworks.com/) where I leverage my expertise in bioprocessing, engineering, and immunology to disseminate information on these fields to better engage the public on scientific concepts.
