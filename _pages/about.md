I am a T32 Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Massachussets General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/) in the [Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases](https://www.massgeneral.org/medicine/ciid). Under the mentorship of [Robert M. Anthony](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3xN1qSIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and Michelle E. Conroy, my research explores the role and regulation of IgG and IgE glycosylation in health and disease. My work in the [Anthony lab](https://rmanthonylab.mgh.harvard.edu/) aims to development strategies that target and modulate glycans on antibodies to produce therapeutics against immunological diseases, such as cancer.

I reciveved my PhD in Biochemical Engineering from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://cbe.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University. My doctoral research focused on engineering a system to [study and control N-linked glycosylation](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/70295/) of monoclonal antibodies for the biomanufacture of immunotherapies. This innovative system, which I developed, was subsequently patented under the name “[N-Glycanyzer](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240110925A1/en)". I served as an [ORISE Fellow](https://orise.orau.gov/FDA/index.html) at the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (FDA-CDER) where I had validating the N-Glycanyzer system, demonstrating its practical applications in a regulatory environment.

I serve as a [Scientific Advisor](https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/scientific-advisory-board) and [Contibutor](https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/editor/aron-gyorgypal-phd) for [Technology Networks](https://www.technologynetworks.com/) where I leverage my expertise in bioprocessing, engineering, and immunology to disseminate information on these fields to better engage the public on scientific concepts.
