excerpt: 'we integrated Agilent's Instant Procainamide based chemistry workflow into the N-GLYcanyzer PAT unit to allow for nearly 10Ã— faster near real-time analysis of mAb glycoforms. Our methodology is explained in detail to allow for replication of the PAT workflow as well as present a case study demonstrating the use of this PAT to autonomously monitor a mammalian cell perfusion process at the bench scale to gain increased knowledge of mAb glycosylation dynamics during continuous biologics manufacturing using Chinese hamster ovary cells.'
