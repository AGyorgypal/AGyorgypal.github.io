<b>Summary:</b> This paper introduces the  N-GLYcanyzer, an innovative Process Analytical Technology (PAT) system for real-time monitoring of monoclonal antibody (mAb) N-linked glycosylation during biomanufacturing. The system integrates automated mAb sampling, purification, N-glycan release, fluorescent labeling, enrichment, and HPLC analysis, offering a rapid turnaround time of 1-3 hours. The researchers optimized glycan labeling and enrichment processes, validating the system against conventional off-line methods. N-GLYcanyzer is suitable for various biomanufacturing scales and compatible with both batch and continuous bioprocessing modes. This advancement enables near real-time monitoring of critical quality attributes, potentially improving process control and product quality in biopharmaceutical production. The systemâ€™s ability to reduce processing time to less than 45 minutes in future iterations makes it a promising tool for enhancing biomanufacturing efficiency.
